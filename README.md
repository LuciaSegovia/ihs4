# Micronutrient Analysis of the Fourth Integrated Household Survey of Malawi


The raw data file can be downloaded from https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/2936. The data files needed to run this analysis are:

1. HH_MOD_G1 = Food consumption
2. HH_MOD_A_FILT = Household information
3. HH_MOD_B = Household roster
4. HH_MOD_D = Health information
5. HouseholdGeovraiblesIHS4 = Geovariables

Please, for the scripts to run you need to:

1. Download the raw data 
2. Create a folder in your local version of this project called `data`
3. Unzip raw data and paste the above mentioned files inside the `data\` (folder)
4. Create a folder called `data/inter-output` to store processed files

Happy coding :)
