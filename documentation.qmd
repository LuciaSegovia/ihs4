## Food items & dealing with others

### Data processing - changes:

1. We made some changes on the units (NSU) and the foods reported under "other"/ "specify". The updated consisted in making those changes in a new variable in other to keep the origina variable as it was. This is good for further/ future analysis and/or reference during the cleaning/analysis steps. 

For the units the new variable which contains the amended codes is called `unit_code_st` while for the variable that contains the amendment codes is called `item_code_st`.

2. Food items labelled as "others". 

'FRESHBEANS', 'GROUND AND COOKED BEANS' was allocated to item (302 - beans brown), although it may be better to keep them as "Other(nuts/pulses)". Some foods in the category others could be kept and as they are. 

## Non-standard units for own production

Assumptions under units reported as "others" (prod_unitA==23):

"PLATE" under item code 23, we are using the unit code = 6. 
"NO. 24 PLATE" under 7B
"SPOON" was assigned to "TEASPOON" unit_code(20)
"TINA (FLAT)" - 25A
"TINA (HEAPED)" , "MEDIUM (PLATE)" - 25B
"20L PAIL" - 4 


Further info is needed for:

- The unit under "heap" have two type of small to large. It should be further checked!

Units not found in the master NSU file (nsu.factor):

- Bottle as it is not reported. 
- Jar is not reported
- Pot
- Slice
- Dengu --> Container (bamboo)


Finally, what we have done is that we have used the "consumed items" cleaned and assigned the same quantity as the code/quantities were the same. 

We checked the maize and products consumed by region, and we can see that maize cooked (boiled or roasted) was not reported as "own production". 

We also identify some items wrongly code, so the item_code should be 102 instead of 101. We are amending it in the "1_ihs4_cleaning.Rmd"
