## Non-standard units for own production

Assumptions under units reported as "others" (prod_unitA==23):

"PLATE" under item code 23, we are using the unit code = 6. 
"NO. 24 PLATE" under 7B
"SPOON" was assigned to "TEASPOON" unit_code(20)
"TINA (FLAT)" - 25A
"TINA (HEAPED)" , "MEDIUM (PLATE)" - 25B
"20L PAIL" - 4 


Further info is needed for:

- The unit under "heap" have two type of small to large. It should be further checked!

Units not found in the master NSU file (nsu.factor):

- Bottle as it is not reported. 
- Jar is not reported
- Pot
- Slice
- Dengu --> Container (bamboo)


Finally, what we have done is that we have used the "consumed items" cleaned and assigned the same quantity as the code/quantities were the same. 

We checked the maize and products consumed by region, and we can see that maize cooked (boiled or roasted) was not reported as "own produciton". 

We also identify some items wrongly code, so the item_code should be 102 instead of 101. We are amending it in the "1_ihs4_cleaning.Rmd"
